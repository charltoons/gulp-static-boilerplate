  "readme": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wearefractal/glob-stream.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wearefractal/glob-stream)\n\n## Information\n\n<table>\n<tr> \n<td>Package</td><td>glob-stream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>File system globs as a stream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Node Version</td>\n<td>>= 0.9</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThis is a simple wrapper around node-glob to make it streamy.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar gs = require('glob-stream');\n\nvar stream = gs.create(\"./files/**/*.coffee\", {options});\n\nstream.on('data', function(file){\n  // file has path, base, and cwd attrs\n});\n```\n\nYou can pass any combination of globs. One caveat is that you can not only pass a glob negation, you must give it at least one positive glob so it knows where to start. All given must match for the file to be returned.\n\n### Options\n\n- cwd\n  - Default is `process.cwd()`\n- base\n  - Default is everything before a glob starts (see [glob2base]](https://github.com/wearefractal/glob2base))\n- cwdbase\n  - Default is `false`\n  - When true it is the same as saying opt.base = opt.cwd\n\nThis argument is passed directly to [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) so check there for more options\n\n#### Glob\n\n```javascript\nvar stream = gs.create([\"./**/*.js\", \"!./node_modules/**/*.*\"]);\n```\n\n## LICENSE\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Fractal <contact@wearefractal.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
